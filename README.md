- 👋 Hi, my name is Pranav Maddineedi.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, science, and math. My favorite language is Python, and I know the fundamentals of Java and learning C/C++. My strengths are Python and game development with pygame. I focus on backend development more than frontend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and ML, specifically reinforcement learning. I am also learning many algorithms (competitive programming). This year I started learning HTML, CSS, and JS for a website that I contribute to and now react native.
- 💞️ I don't need any collaboration for now.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email pmaddineedi@gmail.com.
- 🏆 I am a USACO Silver Contestant
