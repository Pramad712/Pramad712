- 👋 Hi, my name is Pranav Maddineedi.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, science, and math. My favorite language is Python, and I know the fundamentals of Java and learning C/C++. My strengths are Python and game development with pygame. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and ML, specifically reinforcement learning. I am also learning many algorithms (competitive programming).
- 💞️ I don't need any collaboration for now.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email pmaddineedi@gmail.com.
- 🏆 I am a USACO Silver Contestant (finished Bronze in January 2023, and hoping to be in the Gold division by the end of the next contest!)
